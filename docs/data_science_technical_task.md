ABAX Open Assignment – Next Step in Your Application

As the next step in the recruitment process, we would like you to complete the following open assignment. The objective is to assess how you approach solving a problem using real-world data (public datasets).
Important: This is not a coding challenge. The main focus is on your thought process—how you approach a problem, explore data, and derive insights. Your delivery should include code demonstrating your understanding, but the emphasis will be on your process, visualizations, and explanations.
Assignment Details:

1.	Project Choice
      o	You may present a project you have done previously and are proud of, or create something new from scratch.
      o	The project should include a dataset, thorough initial data exploration, and result in new, non-obvious insights or a decision-making process.
      o	Ground your insights in the real world—explain why they make sense, how they are useful, and what value they create.

2.	Data Exploration & Visualization
      o	Make your initial data exploration visual and informative.
      o	Discuss relationships in the data, challenges, and potential pitfalls.
      o	Explain the libraries and algorithms you choose and why.

3.	Production Considerations (without code)
      o	Discuss how your project could be put into production and updated with new data.
      o	Highlight processes, tools, and considerations needed to maintain and scale the solution.

4.	Delivery
      o	Submit relevant code and a report as a link to a GitHub repository.
      o	The scope of the project is up to you, but don't spend too much time: Think of it as a PoC and talk about where you could make improvements rather than making the delivery perfect.

Deadline: It should not exceed a week, but if you need more time, please let us know and we will adjust.
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me or our Hiring Manager - Henning at henning.veflingstad@abax.no or connect via LinkedIn.

We look forward to seeing your approach and insights!

Best regards,
ABAX Team
