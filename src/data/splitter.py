    Split data by driver for better generalization testing.

    This ensures that:
    1. Specified test_drivers (e.g., D6) are ALWAYS in the test set (never trained on)
    2. Additional stratified samples are added from other drivers to reach target test_size

    **Why this matters:**
    - In real-world deployment, models must work on NEW drivers never seen before
    - Random splits leak information when the same driver appears in train and test
    - Driver-level splits provide realistic generalization estimates

    Args:
        X: Features (must contain 'driver' column)
        y: Target (can be numpy array or pandas Series)
        test_drivers: Specific drivers to ALWAYS hold out (e.g., ['D6'])
